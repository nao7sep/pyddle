# Considering my inability to write English proficiently and myself not being an AI (and therefore not fully understanding how AIs understand provided texts),
#     for me, it's often the easiest way to casually write a few simple lines for a prompt and ask an AI to refine it.
# The best part is that I'll always have the original ideas, that I can update and ask the AI to refine again.
