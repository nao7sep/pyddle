# Tasks and Ideas

Just a lazy list of maybes. 😵‍💫

Pending tasks and ideas are mixed and in a highly disoriented order. We'll just get them done.

## MVPs

Explained in: YH45 Project Management.json

* langtree helps me think and log at the same time
* I can casually send Python-based .exe files to people to help them with their tasks
* I have a Python-based TODO web system and an ASP.NET Core-based something with SSO and via-API data exchange
* I have a multilingual collaboration web system that is also for CRM/SFA
* My company has a simple, well-structured website

## Pending

* Check all C#-related files and make yyLib's specs (somewhat) consistent with pyddle's.
* Rename pyddle_testing.py to testing.py. All (or some of) pyddle_*.py will be in products
* Convert (some of) test_langtree.json into an HTML page. Might be interesting to some
* Implement langtree. Should it be a web system? Flask or Django? How long will it take?
* Implement a simple TODO web system. There are a lot of great ones, but it wont hurt to develop a simple one for educational purposes. Now my wife and I seriously need to share our parenting-related tasks
* All scripts must take their parameters in multiple ways: environment variables, KVS, maybe same-file JSON files too
* Hugging Face's Inference Endpoints? How useful would it be if I could analyze an enormous amount of code and text repeatedly with no worries about costs?
* If using a local LLM isnt cost-effective (time-wise), how comfortably can we use the GPT model to analyze code?
* PyInstaller? Will it include module-related files too? Can we automate "compilation"? Like, a script removes some test-related code from a script file, run tests and only then compiles it with necessary modules?
* Make sure everything that MUST be thread-safe is thread-safe. Or at least they are all (reasonably) stateless
* venv? When I just started learning Python, it didnt seem necessary. What about now?
* gunicorn and gevent? I'd like to run a Python-based web system locally
* Celery with RabbitMQ or Redis to manage background tasks?
* Postman?
* How can we include modules that are in another directory?
* Authentication/authorization, especially SSO with Flask, Django, C#'s Identity, etc
* Use an AI to auto-check/document each module/app

## April 2024

* Make a lazy task list
* Check all Python-related files to ensure pyddle is ready for production development
* Ask ChatGPT about the state I might be currently entering => YH45 Project Management.json
