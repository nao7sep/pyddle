Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Based on your criteria focusing on ensuring the code is safe, secure, and stable, without prioritizing efficiency, error handling, or scalability for now, here are the issues and corrections that should be made to address those priorities:

1. **Use of `datetime.UTC`**:
   The `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` usage is incorrect because `datetime` module does not have a `UTC` attribute. To fix this, you should use `datetime.timezone.utc`:

   ```python
   utc_string = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()
   ```

   Similarly, adjust any other usage of `datetime.UTC` to correctly reference the UTC timezone.

2. **Potential for `ImportError`**:
   The imports `pyddle_debugging` and `pyddle_string` are not standard libraries and their functionality is not demonstrated or described in your script. If these are custom modules, ensure they are accessible in your Python environment. If they're not necessary, consider removing these imports or ensuring that the environment where this script runs includes these modules.

3. **Database Schema Types**:
   Although SQLite is dynamically typed and will store your datetime values as text in the `DATETIME` columns, it's important to consistently handle these datetime strings in your application. Your handling appears consistent, but be aware that the storage format does not enforce datetime formats; this affects sorting, comparison, and querying by date unless consistently formatted.

4. **Error Checking and Cleanup**:
   Though your priority is not on enhancing error handling right now, it's crucial to ensure basic SQL operation successes to avoid silent failures, especially when establishing connections, executing queries, and committing changes (where applicable). For instance, exceptions thrown by `cursor.execute()` due to SQLite syntax errors or issues should be caught and handled at least minimally to avoid crashing the application. SQLite operations in Python won't necessarily commit until you call `connection.commit()`, which isn't necessary here since it's a read-only operation, but it would be for insert/update/delete operations.

5. **Resource Management**:
   Using `with` statements for managing the connection and cursor could make the code cleaner and ensure that resources are cleaned up properly automatically, although you are explicitly closing the cursor and connection which is good. For future reference:
   
   ```python
   with sqlite3.connect(":memory:") as connection:
       with connection.cursor() as cursor:
           # Your SQL operations here
   ```

   Note that SQLite connection objects can be used as context managers that automatically commit or rollback transactions, so using `with` for them ensures that your database modifications are safely finalized.

6. **Hard-coded Current Year Calculation**:
   Your script does a calculation of the current year by creating a new datetime object each time. While this works, if the goal is to get the current year in the most direct way without needing a full datetime object with timezone just for the year, consider simplifying this to `datetime.datetime.now().year` or `datetime.datetime.utcnow().year` for consistency with your UTC usage. For the specific query checking rows for the current year, it's fine as-is because it relies on in-database calculations which depend on the values stored in your `utc_string` column.

Considering your priority for code safety, security, and stability, the points above should help ensure your script meets those basic criteria. Other optimizations or refactoring can be considered later as you indicated.
