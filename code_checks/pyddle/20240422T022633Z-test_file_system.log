Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Based on your request to focus solely on critical fixes related to safety, security, and stability, while excluding enhancements around efficiency, scalability, or design pattern adherence, here are the essential issues that should be addressed:

1. **Validation of External Inputs**: If `pyddle_file_system` (pfs) or any other module processes external inputs, ensure that there's validation to prevent harmful content from being processed. This isn't explicitly shown in the script, but considering security, it's crucial.

2. **Handling of File Paths**: The script does not explicitly sanitize or validate file paths (`__file__`, `file_name`) which could pose a security risk if manipulated by an attacker. It's recommended to add checks or use secure methods to handle file paths to avoid vulnerabilities such as directory traversal.

3. **Exception Handling**: Your script lacks explicit exception handling, for example, within file operations (`open_file_and_write_utf_encoding_bom`, `open_file_and_detect_utf_encoding`). Adding basic try-except blocks around these operations can significantly improve the stability by catching and handling I/O errors, file access issues, or unexpected exceptions.

4. **Secure Use of Temporary Files/Directories**: Ensure that the `make_and_move_to_output_subdirectory()` function securely creates and handles temporary files or directories. Use secure methods to generate unique, non-predictable directory names to avoid risks like race conditions or overwriting.

5. **Review Module Imports for Security**: The importing of custom modules (`pyddle_debugging`, `pyddle_file_system`, `pyddle_global`) implies trust in these modules. Verify that these modules do not contain vulnerabilities or unsafe code, especially if they handle file operations or execute system commands.

6. **Secure Handling of Encodings and BOM**: When dealing with file encodings and Byte Order Marks (BOM), ensure the logic in `open_file_and_write_utf_encoding_bom` and `open_file_and_detect_utf_encoding` properly handles edge cases and errors to avoid data corruption or misinterpretation of file contents.

While performance, scalability, and efficient algorithms are not your current focus, the above points are crucial for maintaining a baseline of code safety, security, and stability. Addressing these will help prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of your application against unexpected failures.
