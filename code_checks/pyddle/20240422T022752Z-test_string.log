Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

From your description, it seems you're focused on ensuring the safety, security, and stability of your code over optimizations related to efficiency or scalability at this stage. Given that context, the most critical areas to address in your script involve ensuring that the code handles potential runtime errors gracefully and that functionality behaves as expected. Here are some issues and suggestions to consider:

1. **Handling `NoneType` Operations**: Any operation that involves a variable that could potentially be `None` must be handled carefully. Python will throw a `TypeError` if you try to use a method or operation on `None` that it doesn't support. For instance, attempting string operations on `None` will lead to `'NoneType' object has no attribute '...'` errors. Ensure that your functions are either guarded against `None` input where necessary or documented to specify that `None` is not an acceptable argument.

2. **Correct Handling of Edge Cases**: You seem to be testing edge cases (e.g., empty strings, strings with spaces, etc.). Make sure your functions return logically consistent results in these cases. This includes functions that might receive an empty string or a string composed solely of whitespace characters. 

3. **Index Out of Bounds**: Operations that rely on indexing must handle scenarios where the index is out of the acceptable range for the string. For instance, querying or modifying a character at a non-existent index should be handled to prevent `IndexError`. It might be useful to check indices against the string length and raise meaningful errors or return a default value as appropriate.

4. **Type Checking and Conversion**: Anytime your function expects a specific type (e.g., a string or an integer), ensure you either perform type checking or clearly document the expected type. This is particularly important when your code could potentially cast or convert between types, as doing so improperly can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

5. **Badly Typed Arguments**: Cases like `"".startswith(None)` or passing `None` where a string is expected should either be explicitly checked for and handled in your functions or documented as misuse of the API. Python's built-in type errors will catch some of this, but more specific error messages might improve debuggability for users of your functions.

6. **Non-Integral Indices**: When indices are involved (e.g., checking a substring at a specific position), ensure that these indices are integers and within the valid range. Non-integer types or negative indices (unless you specifically design for and document how negative indices should behave) should be handled or documented as invalid input.

7. **Exception Handling**: Consider adding try-except blocks where runtime errors could occur due to unexpected input types or values. This will allow your script to handle errors gracefully and provide more informative error messages than those Python provides by default.

Focus on ensuring that your functions behave as expected across all valid input ranges and handle invalid inputs gracefully, either by raising informative errors or by returning default values where appropriate. Since you’re prioritizing safety, security, and stability, thorough testing of all edge cases and potential error conditions will be key.
