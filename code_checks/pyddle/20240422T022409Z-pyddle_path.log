Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Your approach to prioritizing safety, security, and stability over efficiency and scalability at this stage is logical given your context. Based on those criteria, here are the necessary corrections and recommendations for your code to ensure it meets your stated priorities:

1. **Handling Special Characters and Reserved Names Correctly**:
    - Your `contains_invalid_file_name_chars` function and `violates_file_name_rules` look sound for basic filename validation against special characters and trailing spaces or periods. However, ensure you're testing these thoroughly, especially with edge cases (e.g., files that only contain special characters or files with multiple trailing spaces).

2. **Windows Reserved Names Validation**:
    - In `is_windows_reserved_file_name`, when checking for COM and LPT names, you have implemented checks for names with lengths 3 and 4 only. Although this captures the primary cases (e.g., COM1 or LPT1), Windows reserved names also include CON, PRN, AUX, and NUL without any numbers. Your check for length 3 and the grouping in `WINDOWS_RESERVED_FILE_NAMES[0]` handles these, but the length-based logic could be misleading or restrictive if expanded names or further iterations are considered in the future.
    - Be mindful that your code should also consider reserved names with any extension (e.g., CON.txt should be invalid), which your code currently handles effectively by stripping the extension before checks.

3. **Case Insensitivity**:
    - Your methods for checking against reserved names and special characters are designed to be case-insensitive (using `pstring.equals_ignore_case`), which aligns with Windows' file system being case-insensitive but case-preserving. This is a good practice for avoiding potential bugs related to filename handling on Windows.

4. **Dependency on `os.path`**:
    - While you mentioned the absence of certain methods in `pathlib` that correspond to `os.path`, your actual code does not demonstrate a reliance on `os.path` functions beyond `os.path.splitext`. Your comment and logic seem aligned, but ensure any further use of `os.path` is compatible or replaced with `pathlib` equivalents if you decide to migrate fully to `pathlib` for path manipulations.

5. **Consideration for File Name Length**:
    - It's mentioned that file name length checks are not performed for reasons documented elsewhere. While this might be acceptable now, keep in mind that extremely long filenames can cause issues on certain file systems. If your application is expected to interact with a wide variety of systems or if user input is involved, adding a length validation might become necessary for stability.

6. **Potential Ambiguities in RESERVED NAMES Handling**:
    - The method to check COM and LPT names iterates through lists with different prefixes (`"C"` for COM and `"L"` for LPT) but does not explicitly check for digits or ensure that names like "COMX" (where X > 9) are not falsely passed as valid. Although your current lists do not include such names, ensuring strict adherence to valid patterns (e.g., "COM" followed by a digit) could improve clarity and prevent future errors if the lists are updated.

Beyond these points, your current priorities suggest that an extensive review for performance or scalability is not necessary. However, keep documentation comprehensive for future maintainability, especially where special cases or assumptions are made.
