Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Based on your request to focus on safety, security, and stability without delving into efficiency, scalability, or advanced design patterns, there's a primary concern in the code that you might need to address. It pertains to the management and validation of the file path, specifically in the context of potential security risks:

1. **Path Validation**:
   - While you are checking whether the path points to a file with `os.path.isfile(file_path)`, consider ensuring that the path is not pointing to a file that should not be accessible or manipulated by the script for security reasons. Without proper validation, there could be a risk if the script is used in an environment where file paths could be supplied in a malicious manner, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files.

Apart from the above point, your script seems to adhere well to the priorities you've outlined. The global usage aligns with your current goals, and basic error handling is in place for the main functionality you've described. The approach to managing the main script file path, within the context you've provided (prioritizing safety, security, and stability over efficiency and scalability), does not show overt signs of critical issues that absolutely must be fixed for the code to operate securely and stably in expected environments.

Ensuring the path does not traverse outside of a designated directory (e.g., a project directory) could add a layer of security. This is commonly referred to as preventing directory traversal attacks. However, the specific implementation of such checks would depend on the broader context of your application's deployment and use case scenarios.
