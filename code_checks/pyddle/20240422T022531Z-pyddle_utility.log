Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

The code provided is generally simple and functional for basic utility purposes, focusing on returning the first non-`None` argument or the result of a function call if all arguments are `None`. Based on your criteria (safety, security, and stability over efficiency and scalability), there are no pressing issues or logical errors to fix in the code snippets provided.

Nevertheless, a minor improvement could be documented to ensure clarity and future maintainability, though not absolutely necessary:

1. **Documentation**: Adding docstrings to your functions could improve the understandability and maintainability of your code. This is especially beneficial if someone else (or you in the future) needs to work with your code. 

Example:

```python
def get_not_none(*args):
    """
    Return the first non-None argument from the given arguments. 
    If all arguments are None, returns None.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg is not None:
            return arg
    return None

def get_not_none_or_call_func(func, *args):
    """
    Return the first non-None argument from the given arguments. 
    If all arguments are None, executes and returns the result of func().
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg is not None:
            return arg
    return func()
```

Given your priorities, these functions do not require further immediate interventions. They meet the criteria of being safe, secure, and stable for a wide range of applications where performance and scalability are not immediate concerns.
