Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Based on the provided text and your criteria focusing on what must absolutely be fixed for code safety, security, and stability, while deprioritizing efficiency, scalability, and advanced error handling or design patterns, here are the critical issues that should be addressed:

1. **Checking for Falsiness Rather Than None**: The methods such as `must_contain`, `must_contain_enum_name`, and `must_contain_enum_value` check `if not value` to decide whether to raise an error. This approach could inadvertently reject legitimate values that are naturally falsy (e.g., `0`, `False`, an empty string `""`, etc.) but may still be valid for your use cases. To precisely target the absence of a value, it may be necessary to change these checks to `if value is None`, assuming that `None` is the marker you're using for "no value was provided." 

    However, since you're focusing on what's absolutely critical and considering that changing this behavior might not strictly fall into 'safety, security, and stability' but rather into 'correctness under all potential use cases', this might not be critical if your domain logic guarantees that such falsy values are actually invalid.

2. **Enum Existence Check**: For `must_contain_enum_name` and `must_contain_enum_value`, there is an assumption that `value` has `.name` and `.value` attributes. This is fine if `value` is guaranteed to always be an Enum member. However, if there's any chance that a non-Enum value could be passed, your code would raise an `AttributeError`. This might not be seen as a critical issue under your stated priorities unless it affects the application's stability.

3. **Consistency in Exception Raising for Enum Methods**: You are raising a generic `RuntimeError` for missing arguments. If `value` passed to the Enum handling methods (`must_contain_enum_name`, `must_contain_enum_value`) doesn't have `.name` or `.value` due to not being an enum, it will raise a less descriptive `AttributeError`. Though it's not a direct 'safety, security, or stability' concern, for clarity and maintainability, you may consider checking if `value` is indeed an Enum member and raising a more informative error if not. Again, this suggestion is more about improving error handling and may not qualify as an 'absolute must fix' under your criteria.

4. **Error Message Clarity**: The error message in each method is the same ("Argument {key} must be provided."). For `must_contain_enum_name` and `must_contain_enum_value`, you might consider specifying in the error that not just any value, but an Enum value is expected. This falls into improving clarity and might help with debugging, but it's not a strict necessity for code security/stability.

Given your emphasis on not overengineering for the sake of efficiency or scalability at this stage, the above issues are relatively minor and mostly relate to improving the handling of edge cases or clarity of error messaging rather than addressing significant safety, security, or stability concerns.
