Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Based on your criteria focusing on safety, security, and stability while deprioritizing efficiency, scalability, and advanced error handling, the following points from the given script need attention:

1. **Data Synchronization and Atomicity**: When updating (both public and private data) or deleting keys, the changes are immediately reflected in in-memory dictionaries, but `save_data_to_file` (which also handles backup operations) is only explicitly called in the `save_public_data_to_file` and `save_private_data_to_file` functions. This might lead to a scenario where in-memory changes are not persisted if the program crashes or exits before calling these save functions. Consider ensuring that data changes are atomically written to disk (and backed up) immediately upon modification to maintain data integrity.

2. **Data Race Conditions**: Given the use of global variables for in-memory storage and lack of explicit thread safety mechanisms, concurrent access to the key-value store from multiple threads could lead to race conditions, potentially resulting in data corruption or loss. If your application might run in a multi-threaded environment or handle concurrent requests, consider implementing locking mechanisms around data reads/writes to ensure thread safety.

3. **Exception Handling in File Operations**: While aiming for simplicity, basic exception handling around file IO operations (`os.path.isfile`, `pfs.read_all_text_from_file`, `pfs.write_all_text_to_file`, etc.) could prevent unforeseen crashes due to permissions issues, disk I/O errors, or file system limits. At minimum, catching and logging IO-related exceptions could aid in diagnosing and recovering from errors.

4. **Security Consideration with `json.loads` and `json.dumps`**: Ensure that any data deserialized with `json.loads` comes from a trusted source or is properly validated, as constructing objects from untrusted JSON data can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. While `json` module operations are generally safe, be cautious about adding unsafe operations in the future.

5. **Backup Operation Reliability**: The in-script comment suggests that the backup operation should not cause the program to crash if it fails. Ensure the `pbackup.backup` function adheres to this, silently catching and logging its failures without throwing unhandled exceptions that could impact the main application's stability.

Considering you prioritize code stability over implementing more complex design patterns or optimizations, addressing the points above should ensure your code meets basic standards for safe, secure, and stable operations without significant architectural changes.
