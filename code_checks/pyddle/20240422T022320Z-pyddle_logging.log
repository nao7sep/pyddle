Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

The script you've shared does generally adhere to a simple, straightforward approach to logging, which seems to align with your priority of obtaining a solution that is safe, secure, and stable over being highly efficient or scalable at this stage. Given this context, here are the most critical issues and areas that should be addressed to ensure the script meets those basic requirements:

1. **Incorrect Module Imports**: 
   - The script imports modules such as `pyddle_datetime`, `pyddle_file_system`, etc., which are not standard Python libraries. If these are custom modules you've written, ensure they are correctly referenced and accessible in your project. Otherwise, for functionality like opening files, consider using standard libraries (`datetime`, `os`, etc.) that are already imported. 
   - Also, `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` should be replaced with `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)` if using the standard `datetime` library, as `datetime.UTC` is not a valid attribute.

2. **Error Handling in File Operations**:
   - While you mentioned not wanting to add precise error handling, basic error handling for file operations is crucial to ensure the script is stable and secure. Wrapping file operations (e.g., `os.makedirs()` and file writing in the `flush` function) with a `try-except` block can help catch unexpected errors, such as permission issues, and handle them gracefully.

3. **Global Variables for Lazy Loading**:
   - Using global variables (`__logs_directory_path` and `__log_file_path`) with lazy loading is a pragmatic choice. However, ensure that their usage (especially when modifying them) is thread-safe if your application might evolve to a multi-threaded context in the future. For the current single-threaded application, this is adequate but keep scalability in mind.

4. **Potential Issue with `log_lines` Implementation**:
   - The `log_lines` function uses `if parts[1]:` which assumes that `split_line_into_parts(line)` returns a collection where the second element reliably indicates something specific (perhaps whether the line is not empty). This is not a standard Python function and its behavior is not clear from the provided context. Make sure its implementation aligns with how it’s used here to prevent any runtime errors or logical bugs.

5. **Security Concerns**:
   - While not explicitly mentioned, always consider the content being logged for potential sensitive information leakage. Ensure that any use of the logging function does not inadvertently log sensitive or personal identifiable information (PII). Although this doesn’t directly relate to the given code, it’s an essential practice for maintaining application security.

6. **Dependency on Developer to Set Main Script File Path**: 
   - The requirement to manually set the main script file path (`pyddle_global.set_main_script_file_path()`) could lead to runtime errors if forgotten. Automating this or providing a clear error message if the path is not set could make the module more robust.

Given your emphasis on simplicity and stability over efficiency and scalability, these are the points that you would "absolutely have to fix" or at least seriously consider. Beyond these, further refinements and enhancements can wait until they align more closely with your project priorities.
