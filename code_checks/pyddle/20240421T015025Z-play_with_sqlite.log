The code snippet provided is intended for educational purposes and interacts with an SQLite database in memory. It outlines handling, storing, and querying datetime values within SQLite. Here are several potential issues and improvements that could be made to enhance readability, reliability, and efficiency:

1. **Use of Undeclared Modules**:
   - The script uses `pyddle_debugging` and `pyddle_string` modules, which are not standard Python modules. Without context or imports for these, the code is not immediately executable in a standard Python environment. These should either be included as part of the documentation or replaced with standard Python functionality if possible.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The code lacks error handling around database operations, which could result in uncaught exceptions in case of database errors, syntax errors, or connection problems. Wrap SQLite operations in try-except blocks to catch and handle these exceptions gracefully.

3. **Securely Handling Input**:
   - The script correctly uses parameter substitution (`?`) in the `INSERT INTO` statement, which is good practice to prevent SQL injection. It’s important to ensure all dynamic queries follow this practice.

4. **Datetime Handling**:
   - Although the script demonstrates an understanding of dealing with UTC and local time, using the SQLite `DATETIME` function directly with strings like `'now', 'utc'` or `'now', 'localtime'` is already efficient. However, when the script calculates `utc_string` and `localtime_string` in Python and then immediately converts them in SQLite queries, it potentially introduces redundancy. Consider if direct SQLite `DATETIME` functions can meet your requirements without pre-converting in Python to streamline the code.
   - Make sure to explicitly handle timezones if your application requires accurate timekeeping across different locales. Python datetime's `now()` method does not handle time zones unless explicitly given.

5. **Column Type Choices**:
   - SQLite uses dynamic typing for columns, so specifying `DATETIME NOT NULL` does not enforce a specific format or type beyond being non-null. Your format consistency for datetime values depends on your application's discipline in inserting data correctly. Clarifying comments or documentation on the expected datetime format(s) can help maintain consistency.

6. **Resource Management**:
   - Use context managers (`with` statement) for managing database connections and cursors to ensure they are properly closed even if an error occurs. For example:
     ```python
     with sqlite3.connect(":memory:") as connection:
         with connection.cursor() as cursor:
             # Database operations
     ```

7. **Unused Variables**:
   - The script defines `data` multiple times for different queries but does not utilize it beyond printing or the count check later. Ensure variables are named and used clearly to avoid confusion or redundancy.

8. **Data Retrieval Efficiency**:
   - The script retrieves all columns with `SELECT * FROM table1`. If you're only interested in specific data, specify those column(s) directly to potentially improve performance and minimize memory usage, especially with larger tables.

9. **Hardcoded Year in Query**:
   - The year is fetched by calling `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC).year` within an SQL query to compare against a column value. This could be made more efficient or clear by either storing this year in a variable if used multiple times or by ensuring that direct comparison is the most efficient way to meet the requirement.

10. **Dependency on External Libraries for Simple Tasks**:
    - The code uses `pstring.LEVELED_INDENTS[1]` for formatting output. It seems like an overcomplication for what appears to be simple text indentation. A straightforward approach could involve using hardcoded indentations or standard Python libraries unless `pstring` offers significant advantages.

This feedback aims at enhancing the code's maintainability, performance, and robustness.
