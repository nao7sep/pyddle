The Python script provided introduces a mechanism to manage the file path of a "main script" within a Global variable, incorporating functions to set and retrieve this path. Here are potential issues and improvements that could be addressed:

1. **Global Variable Use**:
   - *Issue*: Using a global variable to store state (in this case, the file path of the main script) can lead to issues in larger, more complex applications where the variable may be inadvertently modified or accessed in an undesired manner.
   - *Improvement*: Consider encapsulating this functionality within a class, which can provide a more controlled access and modification mechanism through methods. This can enhance the maintainability and readability of the code.

2. **Type Hinting**:
   - *Issue*: The type hint `str | None` for `MAIN_SCRIPT_FILE_PATH` is correct but using the `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of the file (for Python versions that require it) could make this notation compatible with older Python 3 versions.
   - *Improvement*: Ensure compatibility with older Python versions where newer syntax might not be supported without specific imports.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - *Issue*: The error message `"File not found: {file_path}"` in `set_main_script_file_path` method might not provide enough context for debugging. The actual reason for the file not being found or whether the path was incorrect could be valuable.
   - *Improvement*: Additional logging before raising the error could provide context, such as logging if the path is absolute or relative, or if there are permission issues that prevent the file from being detected even if it exists.

4. **Function Documentation**:
   - *Issue*: The docstring for `get_main_script_file_path` could include the fact that it returns the main script file path and under what conditions it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   - *Improvement*: Expanding the docstrings to include more details about the functions' behaviors, exceptions, and return types would enhance code documentation and readability.

5. **Dependency on `os.path`**:
   - *Issue*: The script uses `os.path.isfile` to check if the file exists. While functional, the `os.path` module is somewhat outdated in newer Python versions.
   - *Improvement*: Consider using the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented interface for file system paths. `Path(file_path).is_file()` could be a more modern and readable approach.

6. **Global Commenting**:
   - *Issue*: The comment `# pylint: disable = global-statement` may be necessary for linting purposes but suggests an awareness of the undesirable use of global variables.
   - *Improvement*: If moving away from a global variable design is not an option, ensuring comprehensive documentation on why this approach was chosen and outlining the precautions taken to mitigate common pitfalls associated with global variables can be helpful.

7. **Exception Specificity**:
   - *Issue*: The function `set_main_script_file_path` raises a `RuntimeError` for file not found, which is a very general exception.
   - *Improvement*: Consider defining a custom exception class for this specific type of error. This would allow users of the function to catch and handle this specific error more gracefully and clearly.

8. **Return Types**:
   - *Issue*: The function `get_main_script_file_path` could benefit from clear type hinting in its signature to indicate that it returns a string.
   - *Improvement*: Change the function signature to `def get_main_script_file_path() -> str:` for better clarity and consistency with static type checkers.

By addressing these issues and considering the suggested improvements, the script's design, readability, and maintainability could be significantly enhanced.
