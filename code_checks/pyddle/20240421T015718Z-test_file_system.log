The script provided seems focused on testing the `file_system` module's handling of different UTF encodings, particularly in creating files with different encodings, writing to them, and then reading from them to verify their content and size. Below are some potential issues and suggestions for improvements:

### Potential Issues:

1. **Missing Error Handling:**
   - The script lacks explicit error handling, such as `try-except` blocks around file operations which could throw exceptions if a file cannot be created, written to, or read from. Implementing error handling would make the script more robust.

2. **Dependency on External Modules:**
   - The script uses `pyddle_debugging`, `pyddle_file_system`, and `pyddle_global` without mentioning their installation or import from external sources. Ensuring and documenting how to obtain these modules would be helpful.

3. **Hardcoded Encoding Assumption:**
   - By writing and reading with specific encodings and expecting correct behavior without verification, there's an assumption that all systems will handle these encodings uniformly. A verification step before or after writing could ensure the file's correct encoding.

4. **Global State Modifications:**
   - The call to `pglobal.set_main_script_file_path(__file__)` modifies a global state, which could have unintended side effects depending on the implementation of `pyddle_global`. Isolating tests or using a more localized approach might be safer.

5. **Inefficient String Manipulation:**
   - The manipulation of `encoding_in_lowercase` to create a file name is somewhat inefficient and could be streamlined. For example, the `replace` function call is done on each iteration, even though it's a predictable transformation.

6. **Lack of Output Validation:**
   - The script prints the file name, its content, and size but doesn't validate these outputs against expected results. Adding assertions or checks would turn print statements into actual test validations.

### Suggestions for Improvements:

1. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Wrap file operations in `try-except` blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions, logging or printing errors as appropriate.

2. **Documentation on Dependencies:**
   - Provide a `requirements.txt` file for external dependencies or document where and how to install the `pyddle_*` modules.

3. **Encoding Validation:**
   - After writing, verify the file's encoding explicitly (if possible) to ensure the operation's success. This could involve using external tools or libraries designed to check file encodings.

4. **Use Temporary Files/Directories for Testing:**
   - Consider using Python's `tempfile` module to create temporary files and directories for tests. This prevents clutter and potential overwrites in the working directory.

5. **Streamline String Operations:**
   - Optimize string manipulation by performing repetitive operations outside loops or using more efficient methods.

6. **Output Validation:**
   - Convert print statements to assertions or introduce checks that compare the actual outcomes with the expected ones, to ensure that the test acts as a real verification step.

7. **Add Comments and Documentation:**
   - Include comments and docstrings explaining the purpose of each test and the significance of each operation. This would make the script more maintainable and understandable to new contributors or maintainers.

8. **Consider a Testing Framework:**
   - Utilizing a testing framework such as `unittest` or `pytest` can provide a structured way to define and execute tests, making the process more standardized and easier to integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
