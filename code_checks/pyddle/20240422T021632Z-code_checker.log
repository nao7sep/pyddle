Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

To accurately address the request without analyzing specific Python code, I'll provide general guidance on critical issues that developers should prioritize fixing in any Python project for safety, security, and stability. Addressing these issues aligns with your current priorities and helps ensure that your codebase remains manageable and robust as you scale or enhance your project later.

1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**
   - **SQL Injection:** If your code interacts with a database, ensure all queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - **Command Injection:** Avoid using user input directly in functions that execute system commands. Validate or sanitize user inputs meticulously.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) for Web Applications:** If dealing with web applications, encode or escape user inputs when rendering to prevent XSS attacks.

2. **Data Protection:**
   - **Hardcoded Sensitive Information:** Remove any hardcoded passwords, API keys, or secrets from the code. Utilize environment variables or secure vaults.
   - **Encryption of Sensitive Data:** Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - **Silent Failures:** Ensure that your code does not silently ignore exceptions without logging or handling them appropriately. Silent failures can make debugging and monitoring difficult.
   - **Broad Exceptions:** Catching broad exceptions (e.g., `except Exception:`) can hide bugs. Where possible, catch specific exceptions.

4. **Code Quality:**
   - **Resource Leaks:** Make sure to close or properly dispose of resources like file streams, database connections, or network connections to prevent resource leaks.
   - **Mutable Default Arguments:** Avoid using mutable default arguments for functions, as this can lead to unexpected behavior when default values are modified.

5. **Concurrency Issues:**
   - **Race Conditions:** Be cautious of race conditions if your application is multi-threaded or accesses shared resources. Use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
   - **Deadlocks:** When using locks, ensure that your locking strategy does not lead to deadlocks.

6. **Deprecation Warnings:**
   - **Deprecated Libraries and Features:** Ensure that your project does not rely on deprecated or unsupported libraries and features of Python or third-party dependencies.

Addressing the above issues should greatly enhance the safety, security, and stability of your application. While performance and advanced architectural concerns are not your current priority, establishing a solid foundation in these basic areas will pay dividends as your project evolves.
