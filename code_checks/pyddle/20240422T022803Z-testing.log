Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Given the information provided, there are no explicit details about specific bugs, issues, or logical errors present in the code or project components discussed. The text outlines development decisions and approaches regarding a Python library called "pyddle" and its testing modules. However, without specific code examples or details about existing problems, it's not possible to provide targeted feedback or identify what needs fixing.

For addressing potential concerns without explicit examples of code issues:

1. **Ensure Basic Functionality and Correctness**: Before performance optimizations, make sure that all components, especially those that are critical for production (e.g., `pyddle_*.py` files), are correctly implementing their intended functionalities. This includes thorough testing for edge cases and ensuring that all inputs are handled safely.

2. **Focus on Security and Stability**: As you've prioritized safety, security, and stability, review your code for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, improper error handling) and ensure that it robustly handles unexpected inputs or system states to maintain stability.

3. **Refactor Gradually for Maintainability**: While performance and scalability optimizations are not your current priority, maintainability should be. Keep your code organized to enable easier future refactoring and improvements. This includes documenting your "controlled chaos" approach to testing and module organization, which could help maintain or increase productivity and reduce technical debt over time.

4. **Monitor and Log Appropriately**: Implement appropriate logging for critical errors and warnings. This will not only help in ensuring the stability and security of your applications but also assist in diagnosing issues when they occur.

Remember, even if efficiency isn't a current priority, neglecting code quality entirely can lead to more significant issues down the line. Therefore, balancing productivity with a minimal level of quality assurance is crucial.
