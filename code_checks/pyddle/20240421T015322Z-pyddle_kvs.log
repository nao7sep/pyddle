The script seems generally well-organized and follows a clear structure. However, there are potential areas for improvement and some issues that could be addressed to enhance the code's efficiency, readability, and robustness. Here are several points to consider:

1. **Global State Usage:**
    - The script heavily relies on global variables, which can make the code harder to maintain and debug. Consider encapsulating the logic in a class structure to manage state more effectively.

2. **Error Handling:**
    - There's a lack of explicit error handling when reading from or writing to files. Misconfigured file paths, permission issues, or corrupt JSON data could all cause unhandled exceptions. Adding try-except blocks could improve robustness.

3. **Data Loading Efficiency:**
    - Data is lazily loaded, which is beneficial, but every access method checks if data is loaded before proceeding. After initial loading, this repetitive check is unnecessary. A more streamlined approach or flag to signal data loading completion could improve efficiency.

4. **Concurrent Data Access:**
    - The script doesn't address potential issues with concurrent access to the JSON files. In multi-threaded or multi-process applications, this could lead to data corruption or loss. Implementing file locks or using a more robust data storage solution would help.

5. **Dependency on External Libraries:**
    - The script depends on custom modules (`pyddle_backup`, `pyddle_file_system`, etc.) without any documentation or error handling around these imports. If these modules are not available or fail, the script will crash. Consider adding documentation on dependencies or fallback mechanisms.

6. **Saving Mechanism:**
    - Data is only saved manually by calling the specific save functions. This could lead to data loss if the script is terminated before saving. Implementing an automatic or scheduled save feature could mitigate this risk.

7. **Hardcoded File Names:**
    - The JSON file names are hardcoded, which reduces flexibility. Allowing file names or paths to be set through configuration or initialization parameters would make the script more versatile.

8. **Backup Mechanism:**
    - The backup functionality is mentioned but not fully explained, and it's implicitly assumed that the backup will not fail. Adding more detailed handling and feedback about the backup process might be beneficial, especially for critical data.

9. **Mixed Data Visibility:**
    - The script combines public and private data in a single merged view without clear separation or access control. This might lead to unintentional data exposure. Consider implementing explicit controls or separate access methods for sensitive data.

10. **JSON Performance:**
    - For large datasets, JSON might not be the most efficient format. If performance becomes an issue, exploring alternatives like binary serialization formats or databases might be warranted.

11. **Non-Existent File Handling:**
    - The script assumes that if files do not exist, they simply contain no data. While this may be acceptable, explicitly checking and possibly creating these files on startup could prevent confusion or errors in file handling later.

12. **Case-Sensitive Keys:**
    - The script mentions the case sensitivity of keys as a potential issue but does not address it. Offering an option to handle keys in a case-insensitive manner (e.g., by always converting them to lower or upper case) could improve usability.

13. **Documentation and Comments:**
    - While there are some comments in the code, a more thorough documentation, including function docstrings and a high-level overview of the script's functionality and architecture, would enhance maintainability and ease of use.

14. **Test Coverage:**
    - There's no mention of tests. Implementing unit tests and integration tests would significantly increase the reliability and maintainability of the code.

Addressing these issues and considering the suggested improvements could greatly enhance the script's functionality, usability, and robustness.
