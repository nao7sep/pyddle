Reviewing and providing feedback on the code snippet involves analyzing potential issues and areas for improvement related to code functionality, error handling, design principles, optimization, readability, and maintainability. Here's a comprehensive review covering various aspects:

1. **Global Variable Usage (`__backup_file_path`)**:
   - **Issue**: Relying on a global variable for the backup file path can make testing and modification challenging. It restricts the flexibility of specifying different paths for different purposes or environments.
   - **Improvement**: Consider implementing a class-based approach where the backup file path is an instance variable. This would enhance encapsulation and make the module more adaptable.

2. **Database Schema Hardcoding**:
   - **Issue**: The database schema is hardcoded within the `backup` function. This could lead to issues if the schema needs to evolve or if the function is called multiple times, leading to inefficiency.
   - **Improvement**: Move the schema creation to a separate initialization function that's called once during application startup, or check for the existence of the table at a more global level rather than within every call to `backup`.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - **Issue**: Broad exception catching (`except Exception:`) can mask potential bugs and make debugging difficult. Furthermore, suppressing exceptions with a `quiet` flag inside critical operations like database interaction could lead to data inconsistency without notice.
   - **Improvement**: Narrow down the exception handling to specific exceptions that are expected to occur, such as `sqlite3.DatabaseError`. Additionally, consider logging error details for easier troubleshooting, even when operating in quiet mode.

4. **Function Complexity (`backup` and `restore`)**:
   - **Issue**: Both functions are quite long and handle multiple responsibilities, from managing database connections to processing different value types.
   - **Improvement**: Break down the functions into smaller, more focused components. For instance, separate the concerns of database connection management, query execution, and value processing.

5. **Value Type Checking**:
   - **Issue**: The enforcement of value types (e.g., `str` or `bytes`) is done through runtime checks within the `backup` function. This might lead to runtime errors that could have been caught earlier.
   - **Improvement**: Utilize Python's type hints more effectively along with static analysis tools to catch type mismatches at development time rather than at runtime.

6. **Hardcoded Encoding (`ascii` for Base64)**:
   - **Issue**: The usage of ASCII for decoding Base64 encoded bytes might not be necessary since Base64 encoding is designed to be ASCII safe already. This could lead to confusion or unnecessary complexity.
   - **Improvement**: Simplify the code by removing the explicit `"ascii"` decoding parameter unless there's a specific requirement for it.

7. **Security Considerations**:
   - **Issue**: The script does not mention or handle any security concerns related to storing sensitive data in the SQLite database.
   - **Improvement**: Add encryption for sensitive values before storing them in the database or consider using more secure storage mechanisms if the data is highly sensitive.

8. **Documentation and Readability**:
   - **Issue**: The functions have minimal inline comments explaining the logic, especially in complex areas. There's also no module-level docstring explaining the purpose and usage of the module.
   - **Improvement**: Enhance readability and maintainability by providing comprehensive docstrings for the module, functions, and complex logic sections. This helps future maintainers and users of the code understand its purpose and functionality better.

9. **Error Messages and Debugging**:
   - **Issue**: Error messages, especially in the RuntimeError exceptions, are generic and may not provide enough context for debugging.
   - **Improvement**: Include more specific details in error messages, such as the invalid input that triggered the error, to aid in debugging and user guidance.

10. **Testing and Validation**:
    - **Issue**: The code snippet does not include any tests or mention a strategy for testing.
    - **Improvement**: Implement unit tests to cover various scenarios, including edge cases for input types, database connection issues, and error handling paths. This would ensure robustness and facilitate future enhancements with confidence.

Addressing these points can significantly enhance the module's functionality, robustness, and maintainability, making it more reliable and user-friendly.
