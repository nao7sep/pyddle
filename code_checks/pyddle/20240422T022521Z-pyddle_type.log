Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Given your priority for code safety, security, and stability over efficiency or scalability at this phase, there are a few key recommendations to consider for your current implementation. These recommendations are focused on ensuring the robustness and correctness of your code.

1. **Broad Exception Handling:**
   - Your current exception handling uses a broad `except Exception`. While this is generally discouraged in favor of catching specific exceptions, since your priority is stability and not necessarily adhering to best practices for error management, it might be acceptable. However, be aware that this approach can catch unexpected exceptions, potentially masking other errors. Specific to your use cases (like conversion functions), you might want to catch specific exceptions like `ValueError` for string to numeric type conversions, ensuring you're only handling the expected errors.

2. **Dependency on External Module:**
   - The script relies on an external module named `pyddle_string` for string operations. Ensure that this module is secure, well-maintained, and does not introduce vulnerabilities or stability issues. There's no specific fix here unless there exists known issues with `pyddle_string`.

3. **Error Messages:**
   - The error messages are clear in indicating what went wrong ("Invalid boolean string", "Invalid enum name", etc.), which is good practice for debugging and understanding failures. There is no change needed here as this aligns with your priorities for code stability and safety.

4. **Fallback Defaults and Type Consistency:**
   - When providing default values for conversion functions, ensure that the default value's type is consistent with what the function would normally return. This isn't an issue your code currently violates, but it's a general caution to avoid type inconsistency that could lead to unexpected behavior down the line.

5. **Function Definitions:**
   - The function definitions you provided seem logically sound with respect to your stated goals. Each function has a clear purpose, and you've implemented fallbacks (the "_or_default" variants) that contribute to the overall stability of the application by preventing it from crashing due to unhandled input.

6. **Validation of Enum Conversions:**
   - Your handling of enums seems comprehensive, checking both by name and by value (across various data types). Since enums can be particularly tricky in terms of type and value safety, your thorough approach here aligns well with your priorities. Just ensure that any enum types you're working with are well-defined and stable.

7. **Performance Considerations:**
   - While performance is not your current priority, it's good that you're aware of the potential for future optimizations. This awareness means when you do shift focus, you'll already have an understanding of where improvements can be made, such as reducing hardcoded literals, refining algorithms, or refactoring to reduce the use of broad exceptions.

In summary, your current implementation aligns well with your priorities of stability, safety, and security. While there are always areas to consider for improvement, focusing on specific exception handling and maintaining consistent type use are your key takeaways. Keep an eye on the `pyddle_string` module dependency for any external risks.
