Analyzing the provided code reveals several potential issues and areas for improvement:

1. **Error Handling:**
   - The code snippet lacks comprehensive error handling, especially for database operations and file handling. Adding try-except blocks around SQLite operations and file I/O actions could improve robustness.

2. **Database Connections:**
   - Each `delete_relevant_rows` call opens a new connection to the database. For frequent operations, it's more efficient to manage a single database connection or use a connection pool.

3. **Security:**
   - SQL Injection: The code appears to be safe from SQL injection because it uses parameterized queries (`"DELETE FROM pyddle_backup WHERE key IN (?, ?, ?)"`, `cursor.execute(...)`). However, it's essential to maintain this practice consistently across all SQL queries.
   - Database Encryption: If the backup data contains sensitive information, consider encrypting the database file.

4. **Code Duplication:**
   - There's a pattern of repetitive code, especially in the `for days_ago_item in days_ago` loop where backups are created. Creating a more generalized function that handles iteration could reduce redundancy.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - The code snippet seems to lack inline comments and function docstrings. Adding these could improve code readability and maintainability.
   - There are no explicit unit tests. Implementing tests using a framework like `unittest` or `pytest` would help ensure code reliability and make future changes safer.

6. **Performance:**
   - In `delete_relevant_rows`, the code commits after executing a single SQL command. In use cases involving many deletions, it's more efficient to accumulate changes and commit once.
   - For loops that insert or query the database extensively, consider ways to batch operations or use transactions to reduce overhead.

7. **Code Correctness and Quality:**
   - The use of globals (e.g., `utc_now`, `days_ago`) might lead to issues in a larger, more complex system. Encapsulating functionality and passing parameters explicitly can make the code more predictable and testable.
   - Variable naming conventions are mostly clear, but avoiding abbreviations like `str_` and giving more descriptive names would improve readability.
   - Using magic numbers (`pstring.LEVELED_INDENTS[1]`) makes the code less understandable. Defining these as named constants could clarify their purpose.

8. **Usability:**
   - The `restore_and_print` function could be made more user-friendly by providing default arguments or configurations that cover common use cases, thus simplifying the function call for end-users.
   - The output format is plain text, which might not be the most readable or usable format for large datasets. Adding options for outputting to other formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) could increase usability.

9. **Date and Time Handling:**
   - The code does not currently handle timezones beyond UTC. If the application is intended for users in various timezones, adding explicit timezone support using the `pytz` library or Python 3.9+'s `zoneinfo` module would be beneficial.

10. **Hardcoding:**
    - Path to the database is presumably hardcoded inside `get_backup_file_path()`. This could limit the flexibility of the script. Consider allowing the database path to be configurable through command-line arguments or a configuration file.

Addressing these issues and considering the suggested improvements would greatly enhance the code's maintainability, reliability, and usability.
