Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Given your criteria for reviewing the code—focusing on ensuring the code is safe, secure, and stable, without prioritizing efficiency, error handling enhancements, architectural improvements, or the avoidance of hardcoded literals—I'll highlight critical issues that need immediate attention:

1. **`datetime.UTC` is not a valid attribute**:

   - The use of `datetime.UTC` in `get_utc_now()` is incorrect because the `datetime` module does not have a `UTC` attribute.
   - **Fix**: Use `datetime.timezone.utc` for obtaining the current UTC time. The corrected function would look like this:
     ```python
     def get_utc_now():
         return datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
     ```

2. **Misinterpretation of `.isoformat()` and lack of timezone information in filename string**:

   - Your method `utc_to_roundtrip_string(utc)` correctly returns an ISO formatted string with timezone information (`+00:00` for UTC).
   - However, when creating a filename string in `utc_to_roundtrip_file_name_string(utc)`, the format `'%Y%m%dT%H%M%S-%fZ'` implies that the string represents UTC time (`'Z'` at the end), but it doesn't explicitly encode the timezone. Moreover, the use of `'-'` before `%f` (microseconds) deviates from standard ISO 8601 notation and could be mistaken for a time offset.
   - **Consideration**: If the filename format is strictly required as is, ensure you document its usage clearly to avoid confusion. Otherwise, consider using a more standard format for representing UTC times, possibly by including explicit timezone information.

3. **String format `%f` precision discrepancy**:
   
   - In the provided filename string format `'%Y%m%dT%H%M%S-%fZ'`, the `%f` directive represents microseconds and is a 6-digit number. You referenced a desire for format parity with a `.NET` output, which you noted might have a different length in microseconds representation (`-5919023`).
   - Given your note "where the microseconds part is just one digit shorter," it’s essential to clarify that Python’s `%f` always returns a 6-digit number. If your intent was to match a specific `.NET` format which might not always use 6 digits for microseconds, Python's behavior will be consistent and not one digit shorter.
   - **Consideration**: If precise matching with a varying `.NET` format is required, additional string manipulation in Python may be necessary.

Based on your stated priorities, the immediate fix required is the correction to the use of `datetime.UTC` to `datetime.timezone.utc` for accurate UTC time retrieval. The other points are considerations based on your description, highlighting mismatches or potential areas of confusion rather than outright errors, given there's no requirement to optimize or significantly refactor the existing approach.
