Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Given your priorities, focusing on safety, security, and stability, I'll highlight issues that directly impact those areas without delving into enhancements for efficiency, scalability, or design patterns. 

However, without the ability to inspect the implementations of `pyddle_console` and `pyddle_logging`, I can only provide advice based on standard Python practices and potential issues inferred from the usage patterns in your script. Here are aspects that you absolutely need to consider:

1. **Type Annotations Consistency**: You've used Python typing in your function parameters (`str_: str | None`, `colors: list[str] | None`), which is good for clarity and type checking. Ensure that your custom modules (`pyddle_console` and `pyddle_logging`) also use type annotations consistently for all functions and that they handle the types you're passing correctly. Mismatched types can lead to runtime errors.

2. **Error Handling for External Modules**: Your script lacks explicit error handling for calls to `pconsole.print`, `pconsole.print_lines`, `plogging.log`, and `plogging.log_lines`. Even if you prefer not to add more precise error handling, at least ensure those modules gracefully handle errors internally. For a code that prioritizes safety and stability, ensuring that your log and print operations cannot cause unhandled exceptions is crucial.

3. **Validation of Function Inputs**: Since you're allowing `None` as a possible input for strings and lists (`str_: str | None`, `str_: list[str] | None`), ensure that the called functions (`pconsole.print`, `pconsole.print_lines`, etc.) are equipped to handle `None` values without issues. If those functions expect non-`None` values, your wrapper functions should check for `None` and either skip calling the external functions or provide a safe default.

4. **Consistent Parameter Names**: You switched from using `flush` in `print_and_log` to `flush_` in the call to `plogging.log_lines`. This might simply be a typo, but such inconsistencies can lead to bugs if parameter names do not match expected names in the `pyddle_logging` module. Verify that the parameter names you use match the expected parameters of the functions you're calling.

5. **Thread Safety and Concurrency Issues**: Depending on how `pyddle_console` and `pyddle_logging` are implemented, there could be potential issues with thread safety, especially if your application is multithreaded or could become in the future. For stability, ensure that both modules can safely handle concurrent accesses, especially for file writing in logging.

Beyond the mentioned points, as long as `pyddle_console` and `pyddle_logging` are implemented with attention to handling various edge cases, your wrapper functions should contribute to a safe, secure, and stable application, given your current priorities.
