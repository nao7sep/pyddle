Given the provided utility functions, let's examine potential issues and improvements that could enhance their usability, readability, and performance.

### Function: `get_not_none`

#### Issues
1. **Lacks Documentation**: There is no docstring explaining the purpose, parameters, and return value of the function. This can make it harder for others (or even the original author at a later time) to understand its intended use.
2. **Parameter Handling**: While accepting a variable number of arguments makes the function flexible, there could be a clearer explanation or naming convention to indicate its primary use case or the type of arguments expected.
3. **Function Naming**: The name `get_not_none` is somewhat clear but might be made more descriptive to fully capture the essence of what the function is doing, which is essentially finding the first non-`None` value in a list of arguments.

#### Improvements
1. **Adding a Docstring**: A docstring should be added to explain the function's behavior, its parameters, and what it returns.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def get_not_none(*args):
       """
       Returns the first non-None value from the given arguments.
       
       :param *args: A variable number of arguments to check.
       :return: The first non-None argument if present, otherwise None.
       """
   ```
2. **Type Annotations**: Adding type annotations can improve readability and support tools that provide type checking.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from typing import Any, Optional

   def get_not_none(*args: Any) -> Optional[Any]:
   ```
3. **Potential Extension**: The function could be extended to filter out not only None values but also optionally other values the user deems 'empty' or 'invalid' based on a condition or a list of invalid values.

### Function: `get_not_none_or_call_func`

#### Issues
1. **Lacks Documentation**: Similar to the first function, it also misses a docstring.
2. **Function Naming**: The function's name describes its behavior but is somewhat clumsy. A more concise name might benefit usability.
3. **Error Handling**: There's an implicit assumption that the provided `func` will always execute without errors. In real-world scenarios, ensuring that `func` can be called safely (e.g., it does not raise unexpected exceptions) could be an improvement.

#### Improvements
1. **Adding a Docstring**: Provide a clear and concise description of the function's purpose and parameters.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def get_not_none_or_call_func(func, *args):
       """
       Returns the first non-None value from the arguments, or the result of func if all are None.
       
       :param func: A no-argument callable to be called if all arguments are None.
       :param *args: A variable number of arguments to check.
       :return: The first non-None argument or the result of calling func.
       """
   ```
2. **Type Annotations and Error Handling**: Especially for a function like this, specifying that `func` should be a callable and handling potential errors when calling `func` could be important for robustness.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from typing import Callable, Any, Optional

   def get_not_none_or_call_func(func: Callable[[], Any], *args: Any) -> Optional[Any]:
       try:
           # Function logic here
       except Exception as e:
           # Depending on design, either handle the exception or let it propagate with additional context
   ```
3. **Optimizing Function Calls**: If `func` is expected to be a costly operation, ensuring it's only called when absolutely necessary (which is done in the current implementation) is crucial. This could be emphasized in the documentation to inform the users about the expected behavior.

These enhancements can help make the functions more understandable, easier to use, and potentially more flexible for different use cases.
