Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

Given your focus on safety, security, and stability while de-prioritizing immediate enhancements in efficiency, performance, and scalability, the code appears to be well-crafted to meet its current needs. Nevertheless, a meticulous inspection reveals no critical issues that would severely impact the security or stability of your application based on the shared context. The use of libraries and their methods, alongside Python's own features, is proper and follows standard practices.

Your approach is pragmatic, especially when considering the balance between development productivity and code quality. It's evident that care has been taken to ensure the code is clear and maintainable, with a good structure that supports future modifications or enhancements.

However, without runtime context, specific environmental conditions, or user interaction scenarios, it's challenging to foresee all potential runtime issues. It is advisable to maintain vigilance in areas typically prone to security concerns, such as data handling, authentication, and error management. Regular testing, code reviews, and staying updated with the libraries' best practices and security advisories will contribute significantly to the code's safety, security, and stability.

Overall, without explicit evidence of bugs or logical errors within the code snippet and keeping your priorities in mind, the implementation appears to meet the outlined criteria effectively. Future considerations for optimization or scalability should be addressed when they align with your project's evolving requirements and priorities.
