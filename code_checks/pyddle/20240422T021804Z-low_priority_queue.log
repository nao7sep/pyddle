Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

After reviewing the provided script in detail, focusing on essential corrections related to safety, security, and stability, here are the imperatives that need to be addressed:

1. **Serialization and Deserialization Error Handling:**
   - Your `serialize_task` and `deserialize_task` functions do not robustly handle potential errors that could occur with mismatched data formats, unexpected values, or corruption in the task data JSON. While your current approach may work with well-formed data, consider adding error handling to gracefully manage situations where data does not match the expected structure, thereby preventing crashes or undefined behavior.

2. **Use of Copy for Task Duplication:**
   - You are using `copy.copy(task_)` in the `generate_sample_data` and elsewhere for duplicating task objects. Confirm that this shallow copying behavior is sufficient for your `TaskInfo` objects. Given that your objects seem to contain only immutable fields or simple mutable types (like dictionaries for statistics), this should be fine. However, if you extend your objects in the future to contain complex types or external resources, you might need to switch to `copy.deepcopy()` to ensure full duplication.

3. **Time Handling:**
   - You have implemented custom logic to manage UTC times and perform operations based on them. While this appears sound, ensure that all datetime operations correctly handle time zones, especially when performing comparisons or arithmetic that could be affected by daylight saving time changes or different locales. The standard library’s `datetime` and third-party libraries like `pytz` or `pendulum` can assist in managing these complexities more robustly.

4. **UUID Handling in deserialize_task:**
   - When converting from string to `UUID` and vice versa, your code assumes the format will always be correct. Wrapping these conversions in `try-except` blocks can prevent runtime errors if a malformed UUID string is encountered, allowing your application to handle the issue gracefully.

5. **Potential Infinite Loop:**
   - Your main application loop (`while True:`) should include some mechanism to ensure it can be exited or interrupted safely, without relying solely on an "exit" command. While you do have an `exit` command, consider scenarios where an unexpected error or state might prevent that command from being reached. Implementing a maximum iteration count or a keyboard interrupt signal handler can add an extra layer of safety.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure that all inputs, especially those resulting from user input (`input(": ")`) and file reads, are validated before further processing. This includes checking for `None`, type checking, and potentially sanitizing strings to prevent issues like injection attacks or unintended operations. While your environment might currently be deemed secure, it's a good practice to anticipate changes in how your application might be used in the future.

7. **Error Handling in Main Loop:**
   - Your main loop catches and prints exceptions, which is good for debugging but might not be sufficient for all operational errors. Consider categorizing exceptions and handling different types more systematically to maintain application stability. For example, you might want to handle file I/O errors differently from validation errors.

As your application progresses, keep these areas in mind for review and possible enhancement, even if they're not your immediate priority. Stability and security improvements are always valuable, even for applications where performance and efficiency are not the current focus.
