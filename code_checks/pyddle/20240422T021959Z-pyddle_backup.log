Prompt: Bugs, issues, logical errors and whatever that must be fixed, please. Considering the balance between the productivity of development and the quality of code, I have little intention to implement more precise error handling, singleton-based designs, less use of hardcoded literals, more efficient algorithms, etc. They surely will make my code better, but my current priority is not efficiency; as long as the code is safe, secure and stable, performance and scalability can come later. So, please tell me only what I absolutely have to fix.

The Python code you've provided for a backup module primarily using SQLite for its database operations and managing different types of values including strings and bytes, is well-structured for the most part and aligns with your goal of focusing on safety, security, and stability over performance and scalability at the moment. Here are the issues that must be addressed to ensure the code meets these criteria:

1. **Broad Exception Handling:** The use of broad exception handling (`except Exception:`) in your `backup` function is generally discouraged as it can catch and silently ignore errors that you might want to know about, especially since you're focusing on safety and stability. Since you're allowing for quiet failure, it might be more prudent to at least log the exception details somewhere (even if you're not raising them), so you have a record of what went wrong for debugging purposes. This would be particularly important if the code fails to create a new table or insert data into the database, as these operations are critical for the module's functionality.

2. **Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability:** Your code does well to avoid SQL injection by using parameterized queries in all the `cursor.execute` calls. This is a key practice for ensuring the security of code that interacts with SQL databases. There's no explicit issue here, but it's crucial to maintain this approach with any future changes or expansions of the database interaction logic.

3. **Return Type Consistency and Error Handling in `restore`:** The `restore` function is expected to raise exceptions actively compared to the `backup` function. It's important to document the types of exceptions that callers should expect to handle when using `restore`. Additionally, ensure that any errors related to database connectivity or query execution are handled in a way that's informative to the caller. Since this function directly impacts the module's ability to retrieve backups, clear and actionable error messages are crucial for stability.

4. **Date and Time Handling:** The module uses `datetime` objects and assumes all operations are in UTC. This is a good practice for consistency and avoiding timezone-related errors, but it's important to ensure that all parts of the system interacting with this module also adhere to this assumption or are aware of it. If there's any chance of timezone confusion, it might be worth explicitly converting or asserting timezone information where dates and times are handled.

5. **Dependency on External Module for Time Handling:** You're using `pyddle_datetime as pdatetime` for date and time operations, which seems to be a custom or third-party module. Ensure that this module is stable, secure, and maintained. If it's not absolutely necessary, consider using Python's built-in `datetime` module directly for UTC time operations to reduce external dependencies.

Given your current priorities, focusing on these aspects should help maintain the balance between development productivity and code quality. Ensure to keep testing the module extensively, especially around the database interactions and error handling paths, as these are critical for the module's reliability.
