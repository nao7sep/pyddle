Without the execution context or visible outcomes of this script, several potential issues and improvements can be inferred purely based on the provided code. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Modularization and Naming**:
    - The module names (`pyddle_console`, `pyddle_debugging`, etc.) suggest a clear thematic separation, but the prefixes can be redundant if all these modules are part of the same larger `pyddle` package. Consider using more descriptive names without the prefix if the context allows it.
    - The function `print_and_log` might be doing two things, which can be seen as a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle. While logging and printing to console often go hand-in-hand, a clearer separation or a more descriptive name might help in understanding the function's purpose better.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - There's a `# type: ignore` comment with no visible handling for `None` values in `print_and_log_lines`. This approach can potentially lead to runtime errors or undesired behavior. It's generally better to explicitly handle `None` values within the function if they're expected.

3. **Code Duplication**:
    - The script shows repetitions, especially in the testing of `print_and_log` and `print_and_log_lines` functions with various parameters. Consider using loops or another form of iteration to reduce duplication and increase maintainability.

4. **Testing Approach**:
    - The comment indicates that this is a "one-time test" with no automated verification. In a real-world scenario, relying on visual inspection is error-prone and not scalable. Developing a more rigorous testing strategy, possibly involving unit tests that can simulate or capture console output for verification, would be beneficial.

5. **Comments and Documentation**:
    - While there are comments throughout the script, they are somewhat vague (e.g., "Only `str_`."). Improving the comments to provide more context or detail about what is being tested, expected outcomes, or the purpose behind specific tests would make the code more understandable.
    - The script lacks function documentation (docstrings) that explain parameters, return types, and general purpose. Adding such documentation can make the codebase more maintainable and easier for others to understand.

6. **Color Handling**:
    - The reference to `colors = pconsole.IMPORTANT_COLORS` suggests the use of a static color scheme. Considering environmental factors (e.g., console background color) or user preferences might enhance usability. Also, providing a way to disable coloring entirely could improve accessibility and compatibility.

7. **Magic Strings and Values**:
    - The script contains "magic" strings and values, such as the border lines and indents. Extracting these into named constants at the top of the script or an external configuration file would increase readability and make the script more maintainable.

8. **Functionality Overlap**:
    - If `print_and_log` and `print_and_log_lines` share a lot of logic or code, consider abstracting the shared functionality into a private helper function to reduce redundancy and focus on the unique aspects of each function.

9. **Version Control Comment**:
    - The script starts with a "Created" comment with a future date, but there's no indication of version control system usage. Incorporating a VCS like Git and using repositories for version tracking would be preferred over manual comments, ensuring better version tracking and collaboration capabilities.

10. **Use of Global State**:
    - The call to `pglobal.set_main_script_file_path(__file__)` suggests reliance on global state, which can lead to issues with predictability and testing. Ideally, design the system in a way that reduces the need for global state or makes its usage clear and justified.
