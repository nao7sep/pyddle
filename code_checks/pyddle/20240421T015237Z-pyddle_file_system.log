Analyzing the given Python script, several potential issues and improvements can be identified, focusing on robustness, maintainability, efficiency, and best practices.

### General Observations
1. **Use of Undocumented External Modules**: It's assumed `pyddle_global`, `pyddle_path`, and `pyddle_string` are external or custom libraries. Their functionalities are not clear, which might affect the maintainability of the script. Documentation or comments on their purposes would improve understanding and maintenance.

### Specific Functions and Code Blocks

#### `create_parent_directory`
- It relies on `ppath.dirname`, which is presumed to be a wrapper around `os.path.dirname`. If it's performing additional operations not present in the standard library, documenting these would be beneficial.

#### `make_and_move_to_output_subdirectory`
- **Working Directory Side-Effects**: Changing the working directory (`os.chdir`) inside a utility function can have unintended side effects on the calling code, especially in a larger application. This should be documented, or, if possible, avoided.

#### UTF Encodings and BOMs
- **Global Variable Usage**: The `UTF_ENCODINGS_AND_BOMS` structure mixes tuples within a set, which is atypical and may lead to confusion. A list of dictionaries or a dictionary of tuples could be more semantically clear.
- **Error Handling in `get_utf_encoding_bom`**: Returning `None` for unsupported encodings is handled, but explicitly raising an error or warning could aid debugging.

#### File Operations
- **Encoding Error Handling**: `open_file_and_write_utf_encoding_bom` and `open_file_and_detect_utf_encoding` handle encoding explicitly, but there's potential for improvement in error handling. Specifically, `RuntimeError` is raised for unsupported encodings, but using a more specific exception type could clarify intent.
- **Resource Management with `open` Statements**: While the script correctly uses context managers (`with` statement) for file operations, making sure every file operation follows this pattern is crucial to prevent resource leaks.
- **BOM Writing in Append Mode**: The logic checks if the file is empty before writing a BOM in append mode, which is great. However, it assumes that if the file is not empty, it surely starts with a valid BOM, which might not be the case. Some form of validation could be beneficial.

#### ZIP Archives
- **Error Handling and Feedback**: The `zip_archive_directory` and `zip_archive_subdirectory` functions could benefit from more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms. For instance, informing the user about the number of files successfully archived or any errors encountered during the process.
- **Inefficient Recursion**: `zip_archive_subdirectory` recurses without limiting the depth. For very deep directory structures, this might lead to performance issues or a maximum recursion depth exceeded error.

### Best Practices and Code Quality
- **Code Comments and Documentation**: The script contains minimal comments. While the function names are somewhat descriptive, additional comments or docstrings explaining the purpose, parameters, expected outcomes, and potential side effects of each function would significantly enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Consistent Code Formatting**: Ensuring consistent formatting according to PEP 8, such as line length, whitespace, and naming conventions, would improve code readability.
- **Use of Type Annotations**: Adding type hints would clarify what types of arguments a function expects and what it returns, aiding in the development and use of the provided utilities.

### Conclusion
While the script provides a solid foundation for managing file-system-related operations, especially concerning UTF encoding handling and ZIP file creation, addressing the identified issues and considering the suggested improvements would enhance its robustness, maintainability, and usability.
