# Things that are used only for testing purposes.

# We already have pyddle_debugging.py.
# What makes this module different is that the debugging module mainly contains features that can be used even in production code
#     while this module will mainly contain literals and things related to them that are used only in testing.

# UO27 Prompt Engineering.json
# Also, refer to the comments in pyddle_prompts.py.

GRAMMATICALLY_INCORRECT_SHORT_STORY_IN_ONE_PARAGRAPH = "Once upon a time, a cat what could talk walk into a bar where nobody didn't know him none. This cat, he set down at the bar and order a big glass of milk, but the bartender, she say we ain't got no milk so how's about a lemonade instead? Cat, shaking his head, say that'll not do because he don't drink nothing but milk on Tuesdays. Then, out of nowhere, a loud dog wearing a hat comes in, barking up storms and says, hey cat, didn't I seen you at the park yesterday you was chasing your tail and I laughed real loud. Cat, looking all confused, says no that ain't been me, must've been another cat what looks like I do. They argues back and forth until the cow walks in—yeah, a cow—and he's like, y'all seen my farmer? I been lost since morning and ain't nobody seen him. All them, the cat and dog and the cow, decides they gonna help look for this missing farmer, forgetting all about the drinks and who seen who where. So they left the bar and that was that, an odd group of friends on a funnier mission."

This cat, he set down at the bar and order a big glass of milk, but the bartender, she say we ain't got no milk so how's about a lemonade instead? Cat, shaking his head, say that'll not do because he don't drink nothing but milk on Tuesdays. And today it being Tuesday, he don’t bend them rules, no sir.

Then, out of nowhere, a loud dog wearing a hat comes in, barking up storms and says, hey cat, didn't I seen you at the park yesterday you was chasing your tail and I laughed real loud. Cat, looking all confused, says no that ain't been me, must've been another cat what looks like I do. Him and the dog, they gets into a big ol' argument, with the dog laughing and the cat getting all riled up, fur puffing and tail swishing.

In walks a cow, big as you please, into the bar. Yeah, a cow—and he's like, y'all seen my farmer? I been lost since morning and ain't nobody seen him. He's got this big sad look on his cow face, all mooing softly and such. Them others, they stops their fussing to look at him, cause it ain’t every day you sees a cow looking for a farmer in a bar.

All them, the cat and dog and the cow, decides they gonna help look for this missing farmer, forgetting all about the drinks and who seen who where. They set out from the bar, walking down the street like they owns it. Dog’s barking leading the way, cat’s eyes sharp looking for clues, and cow’s mooing sad-like but hopeful.

So they left the bar and that was that, an odd group of friends on a funnier mission, trudging through streets and alleys, asking about the farmer to anyone they meets. Nobody ain't seen him, but they don't give up none. And the day turned to evening and the lights in the town got all shiny, their shadows long and twisty on the road."""
